title: What's Jekyll?
---

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"} is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet 
powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown){:target="_blank"}:

  > Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, 
  > static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. 
  > This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s 
  > page or blog right here from GitHub.
