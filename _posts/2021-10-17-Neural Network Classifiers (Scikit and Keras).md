title: Neural Network Classifiers (Scikit and Keras)
---

This project takes a look at different [neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network){:target="_blank"} 
classifiers and how they can be utilized in an analysis pipeline. 

In this case I was specifically looking
at [Scikit](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/){:target="_blank"} and [Keras](https://keras.io/){:target="_blank"}.
