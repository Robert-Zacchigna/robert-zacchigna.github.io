# Overview

This project focused on collection and analysis air pollution data from the districts in Seoul, South Korea from multiple different data sources and merges them together.

The [AQI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quality_index){:target="_blank"} (**A**ir **Q**uality **I**ndex) is also calculated 
and appended to the dataset based on the PM2.5 measurements in accordance with the different levels specified by the 
[EPA](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/){:target="_blank"} (**E**nvironmental **P**rotection **A**gency).

<ins>This project has four parts:</ins>
* [Part 1 - Data Collection from CSV](#part-1---data-collection-from-csv)
* [Part 2 - Data Collection from Web-Scraping](#part-2---data-collection-from-web-scraping)
* [Part 3 - Data Collection from an API](#part-3---data-collection-from-an-api)
* [Part 4 - Merging, Querying and Graphing Data from SQlite Database](#part-4---merging-querying-and-graphing-data-from-sqlite-database)


# Part 1 - Data Collection from CSV

This part deals with parsing a CSV dataset (from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/bappekim/air-pollution-in-seoul){:target="_blank"}) 
containing air pollution data from different districts in Seoul.

# Part 2 - Data Collection from Web-Scraping

This section scrapes air pollution data from the [KOSIS](https://kosis.kr/eng/index/index.do){:target="_blank"} 
(**KO**rean **S**tatistical **I**nformation **S**ervice), which is the official source of statistical information for South Korea.

{% include view-notebook-buttons.html html=content %}


# Part 3 - Data Collection from an API

The data in this section is collected from the [AQICN API](https://aqicn.org/api/){:target="_blank"} ([docs](https://aqicn.org/json-api/doc/){:target="_blank"}), 
which is an API for retrieving air quality data from countries around the world. This organization works in conjunction with 
[WAQI](https://waqi.info/){:target="_blank"} (**W**orld **A**ir **Q**uality **I**ndex) and was originally founded in Beijing, China.

{% assign notebook_page = "Part 3 - Parse and Reformat South Korean Air Pollution Data (API).html" %}

# Part 4 - Merging, Querying and Graphing Data from SQLite Database

This final section merges all the different datasets together into a [SQLite database](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html){:target="_blank"} 
to query and create graphs from.

Below is a graph of all the merged data, color coordinated by the AQI for that time period:

> **NOTE:** The gap in the graph is the gap in time between the CSV/Web and API's data collection because the API data was 
> collected far more recently than the collected CSV and Web data.
