BlackDoc is a two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that's ideal for websites that require a master-detail layout for viewing of content. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler, and the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) theme.

## Usage

BlackDoc is a theme built on top of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), which provides a fully furnished Jekyll setupâ€”just download and start the Jekyll server. See [the Poole usage guidelines](https://github.com/poole/poole#usage) for how to install and use Jekyll.


## Options

BlackDoc includes some customizable options, typically applied via classes on the `<body>` element.


### Sidebar menu

Create a list of nav links in the sidebar by assigning each Jekyll page the correct layout in the page's [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).

```
---
layout: page
title: About
---
```

**Why require a specific layout?** Jekyll will return *all* pages, including the `atom.xml`, and with an alphabetical sort order. To ensure the first link is *Home*, we exclude the `index.html` page from this list by specifying the `page` layout.


### Scrolling sidebar content

By default, BlackDoc includes a scrolling sidebar that will display your markdown files in alphabetical order.

### Themes

BlackDoc ships with eight optional themes based on the [base16 color scheme](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16). Apply a theme to change the color scheme (mostly applies to sidebar and links).

To use a theme, add anyone of the available theme classes to the `<body>` element in the `default.html` layout, like so:

```html
<body class="theme-base-08">
  ...
</body>
```

To create your own theme, look to the Themes section of [included CSS file](https://github.com/karloespiritu/blackdoc/blob/master/public/css/blackdoc.css). Copy any existing theme (they're only a few lines of CSS), rename it, and change the provided colors.

### Reverse layout

BlackDoc's page orientation can be reversed with a single class.

```html
<body class="layout-reverse">
  ...
</body>
```
